# Project Ozette

The MakeCode team draws its strength from diversity - our membership spans Microsoft
Developer Division ([DevDiv](https://developer.microsoft.com/), 
which brings you cool tools like [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)) and Microsoft 
Research ([MSR](https://research.microsoft.com/), which pushes the state-of-the-art in 
new directions). 

Over the last year, the MSR team, along with interns James Devine and Teddy Seyed, 
has been leveraging MakeCode and designing new technologies to take
making and coding to new domains, starting with fashion tech.

** spanning the world of web services and the web of microcontrollers **

MakeCode TypeScript - bringing TypeScript to memory-starved microcontroller-based devices;
Michal's work on garbage collector, etc.  Run the same code in the web browser and on
the device.
