# Project Ozette

The MakeCode team draws its strength from diversity - our membership spans Microsoft
Developer Division ([DevDiv](https://developer.microsoft.com/), 
which brings you cool tools like [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)) and Microsoft 
Research ([MSR](https://research.microsoft.com/), which pushes the state-of-the-art in 
new directions). 

As you know, the MakeCode team is primarily a bunch of web-heads who fell in love with
microcontrollers. Since 2016, we've been focused on bringing 
the tech we love about the world of the web to the world of microcontrollers. This started
by writing a compiler (in TypeScript) from a large subset of TypeScript to ARM instructions, 
as well as incorporating the web-first Blockly and Monaco editors as MakeCode's primary
ways to program (though we also support C++).  If you didn't know, we've recently significantly
expanded the subset of TypeScript supported by the MakeCode compiler and rewritten the
MakeCode runtime with support for garbage collection ([Read more about the MakeCode compiler](XYZ)).

To date, MakeCode has been used primarily to program single devices, such as the
[micro:bit](https://makecode.microbit.org), 
[Adafruit Circuit Playground Express](https://makecode.adafruit.com), 
and [Arduino-style boards](https://maker.makecode.com).

Over the last year, the MSR team, along with interns James Devine and Teddy Seyed, 
has been leveraging MakeCode and designing new technologies to make it easier
to program a network of microcontroller-based devices.  This work is done under
the umbrella of MSR's [Project Ozette](https://research.microsoft.com/projects/ozette).
